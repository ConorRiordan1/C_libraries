    A-->|valread is zero|G[*close the client socket\n* reset nth index of client_sockets]
    A --> |existing client| C[read data in, process request]
    B -->D[*assign client avalaible client_t struct in array of client sockets, at index n\n* n, is chosen as the first client_t struct in array where socket_fd = 0\n*n != 0, as the zeroith index represents the server]
    D -->E[*assign client poll_fd struct in fds, at index n\n *ensure socket_fd's of fds and client_sockets match at the nth index]
